This script require you have portquery to be on the system, it's need to perform UDP port testing
you can download and extract it from the workstation then copy the .exe to the target machine to user.

Requirements
The script requires PortQry.exe for UDP port testing. You can download it from the An external link was removed to protect your privacy..

Usage
Input Parameters:

domainName: The user's domain (FQDN).
Username: The user's domain and username.
password: The user's password (entered as a secure string).
portquery_path: The path to PortQry.exe.
Functions:

check-server-port-status: Checks if the port is open and returns the DC name, IP, and status of UDP and TCP port 389.
get-sitename-subnet-info: Obtains site and subnet information for the specified domain.
get-subnetid: Converts IP/netmask into subnetID/netmask.
find-dc-site: Determines if a machine belongs to a site and finds its DC.
Process:

The script first checks if the domain name and PortQry.exe path are specified.
It then performs SRV DNS and LDAP queries to locate the DC.
If a site name match is found, it checks the status of UDP and TCP port 389 for the DC.
If no site name match is found, it explores all DCs in the domain and checks their port status.
The script also obtains AD site information and determines if the machine's IP address subnet matches any configured subnet/site.
Example
$domainName = Read-host "Users domain (FQDN)"
$Username = read-host "UserName (Domain\Username)"
$password = read-host "user's password: " -AsSecureString
[string]$portquery_path=".\PortQry.exe"

# Run the script
.\DomainControllerLocator.ps1
Notes
Ensure PortQry.exe is available on the system where the script is run.
This script is for testing purposes only and should not be used in a production environment.
